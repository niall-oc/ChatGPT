However, some theories suggest that there may have been additional shooters involved, but no credible evidence has been presented to support these claims. The official finding remains that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole gunman.

If a bullet entered a persons forehead and exited through the back of their head, would that bullet be travelling from the same location as a bullet that entered the back of their neck and exited through the front of their neck if the shots were fired seconds apart?

No, if a bullet entered a person's forehead and exited through the back of their head, and another bullet entered the back of their neck and exited through the front of their neck, the bullets would not be traveling from the same location if the shots were fired seconds apart. These wounds would indicate that the person was shot from two different directions, which is inconsistent with the idea of the bullets traveling from the same location. The locations of the wounds would suggest that the shots were fired from two separate locations, possibly from two different shooters.

Could Lee Oswald fire a shot then travel from the 6th floor of the Texas School book repository to the street below, then travel through a busy crowd with a gun, unnoticed by police, a distance of 120 meters, then take up a second position to fire a second shot in 6 seconds?

It is unlikely that Lee Harvey Oswald was able to fire a shot, travel from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository to the street below, travel through a busy crowd with a gun, go unnoticed by police, and take up a second position to fire a second shot in 6 seconds. According to the Warren Commission report, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Oswald fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building in approximately 4.8 seconds. This would not leave enough time for Oswald to travel from the building, cross a busy street, and take up a second position to fire another shot. Additionally, the Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in the assassination, and no evidence was presented to suggest that he had help or that he fired from a second location.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Niall O'Connor](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp5kh7DK1MOfyoSGfXEbzOcCb7teIlLIdcNuwp16wA%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

Then how did Lee Harvey Oswald fire two bullets, 4.8 seconds apart, from one location so that a bullet entered a JFK's forehead and exited through the back of his head and a bullet that entered the back of his neck and exited through the front of his neck?

According to the Warren Commission report, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building in approximately 4.8 seconds, and all three shots came from the same location. The Commission concluded that the first shot missed the target, the second shot hit both Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally, and the third shot struck Kennedy in the head. The trajectory of the shots and the wounds to Kennedy and Connally were consistent with all three shots having been fired from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building. The exact details of how the shots caused Kennedy's head and neck wounds remain a subject of debate among experts, but the Warren Commission report remains the most widely accepted official explanation of the assassination.

Despite the acceptance of the Warren Commission report, could it's conclusions about Lee Harvey Oswald being the lone shooter be incorrect?

The conclusions of the Warren Commission report have been disputed and are the subject of ongoing debate and speculation among experts, researchers, and members of the public. While the Warren Commission report remains the most widely accepted official explanation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, many people have raised questions and doubts about its findings. Some of the most common criticisms of the report include the lack of clear evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald to the assassination, the inconsistencies and contradictions in witness statements, and the possible involvement of other individuals or organizations in the planning and execution of the assassination. There is no consensus among experts or the public on the true events surrounding Kennedy's death, and the assassination remains one of the most mysterious and controversial events in American history.

Given your understanding of the laws of physics and the trajectory of bullets when fired and the assassination of president Kennedy. What probability would you ascribe to there being 2 shooters involved?

As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or the ability to assign probabilities. The issue of whether there were two shooters involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is a matter of ongoing debate among experts, researchers, and the public. The Warren Commission report, which investigated the assassination, concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building in approximately 4.8 seconds. However, this conclusion has been challenged by many who believe that there were multiple shooters and that the evidence supports the presence of more than one gunman. The exact details of the assassination and the number of shooters involved remain a subject of speculation and are open to interpretation. Ultimately, the question of whether there were one or more shooters in Kennedy's assassination is unresolved, and definitive proof or evidence is still lacking.
